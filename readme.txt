AI-enhanced filtering for C1 FlexGrid using Gemini-based NLP interpretation.

This sample showcases how to integrate AI-powered query interpretation into ComponentOne’s FlexGrid control using Gemini (or other NLP models). 
It enables users to filter grid data using natural language inputs, which are parsed and translated into valid FilterDefinition XML structures. 
The result is a more intuitive, dynamic filtering experience that doesn’t require complex user-side logic or strict syntax.
